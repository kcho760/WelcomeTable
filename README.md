## Main Features

 WelcomeTable allows users to search for restaurants by cuisine and name, and browse through their pages. If a user would like to make a reservation, they can do so using the reservation form on the right of the show page. Once a reservation is created, the user is taken to a confirmation page which allows them to make updates to their reservation. 
 
 They can also head to their profile page which will show all of their previous and upcoming reservations. Users can update and cancel their upcoming reservations and can leave a review for ones that have passed inside the past reservations tab.
